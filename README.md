* Hello! Welcome to the Calculator application! The puprose of this application 
is to use basic javascript function in order to get inputs from the user and
return mathmatical computations.
## Javascript
* This calculator is heavily used with the help of javascript and highschoolers
have calculators that can even run third party applications and games. If more
time was spent in this code, a design I'd like to implement would be to add
different functionality. A calculator should be versatile and more features would be
essential to the calculator.
